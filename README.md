# Project Name
Enhancing Image Resolution with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
# Description
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a powerful image resolution enhancement technique using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a focus on perceptual loss. Image resolution enhancement is a challenging task with various real-world applications, such as improving the quality of low-resolution images, enhancing old photographs, and enabling better zoom capabilities for digital imagery.
# Key Features
GAN-based Approach: Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.
Perceptual Loss Function: Leveraging pre-trained deep neural networks to preserve important image details during the super-resolution process.
Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: Techniques to prepare training data effectively for improved model generalization.
Training and Evaluation: A well-documented pipeline for training and evaluating the model's performance.
Model Variants: Experiment with different GAN architectures and loss functions for resolution enhancement.
Inference and Deployment: Scripts and guidance for deploying the trained models in various applications.
